# TODO

- [ ] Fixing the error processing arrangement, which is currently a mix of
option and result types.
- [ ] Fix the memory consumption for writing 2-d or 3-d arrays: currently this uses
the flatten() function which is a copy operation.
- [ ] Add more examples.
- [ ] Add more datatypes, especially images.
- [ ] Consider adding a file open-for-update function.
- [ ] Add automatic group paths.
